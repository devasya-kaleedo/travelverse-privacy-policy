        <h1>Privacy Policy for Travelverse</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Effective Date: 1st December, 2024</h2>

        <p>At Travelverse ("we," "our," "us"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your
            personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information when you use our mobile
            application ("App"). Please read it carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal data from users through the App. We do not request, process, or store any
            personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, phone number, or location, from
            you when you use the App.
            However, the personal information mentioned has been communicated to us by you and stored by us through
            prior communication either via digital means such as email,sms,messages or offline communication.
            This stored information is used for authentication purposes and served back to the app on entering the
            correct credentials provided to the user via external communication.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Provided by the Backend</h2>
        <p>While the App does not directly collect personal information, it retrieves token-based data from our secure
            backend. This data is read-only and provided specifically for your use in the App, based on the token
            assigned to you. The data served to the App is limited to what is necessary for providing the features and
            content you request. The data received by the App thus is stored on the device for future use.</p>

        <h2>3. How Data Is Processed</h2>
        <p>Your data is securely processed and stored in our backend servers, which are designed to ensure privacy and
            security. The token-based system ensures that only the data corresponding to your token is sent to the App.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data from the App with third parties. Any third-party services (e.g., analytics,
            advertisement) that may be used are solely related to the backend infrastructure and do not involve the
            collection of any personal information or data from the App user.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously. Our backend systems are protected with industry-standard
            security measures to ensure that your data is secure while being transmitted between the App and our
            servers.</p>

        <h2>6. File Storage Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App request file storage permissions on the device it is being used on to provide features such as file
            download and offline access to files.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through the App or on
            our website. By continuing to use the App, you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
